about: `
I am Benjamin Oluwadamilola David, a Full-Stack Developer passionate about building high-performance, security-critical websites, web apps, and [Progressive Web Apps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app). I am a self-taught developer with a strong focus on learning and mastering cutting-edge technologies.\n
I have experience teaching private students web design using HTML and CSS, and in 2023, I had the privilege of guiding a pupil through the fundamentals of JavaScript.\n
With over 3 years of experience in web development, I have worked on various projects, specializing in building high-quality web and mobile applications using React, Next.js, JavaScript, and modern front-end technologies.
Beyond my primary tech stack in web development, I have ventured into Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, expanding my expertise in the field with Python. I enjoy exploring new technologies and staying updated with the latest advancements in the industry.\n
One of my notable projects is the [Diamond Heist Mining App](https://t.me/Diamondheistbot?profile), a cutting-edge Telegram mini-app that allows users to mine and earn cryptocurrency (a simulation). I have also worked on web development projects for various clients, including [Absolute Wellness Services](https://absolutewellness.vercel.app/), along with many other freelance projects over the years.\n
Feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaborating or hiring me! üöÄ
