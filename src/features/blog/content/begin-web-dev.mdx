## Introduction

Web development continues to be one of the most in-demand skills in the tech industry. Whether you're looking to build your own projects, freelance, or land a job at a tech company, 2025 is a great time to start. This guide will walk you through the essential steps to kickstart your journey in web development.

## 1. Understand the Basics of the Web

Before diving into coding, it’s important to understand how the web works:
- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language):** The structure of web pages.
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):** Styling and layout of web pages.
- **JavaScript:** Making web pages interactive.

Start with free resources like:
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/)
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
- [CS50 by Harvard](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/)

## 2. Choose a Development Path

Web development has different specializations. Choose the one that suits you:
- **Frontend Development:** Focuses on UI/UX using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, or Vue.js.
- **Backend Development:** Deals with databases, servers, and APIs using Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), or Ruby on Rails.
- **Full-Stack Development:** Combines frontend and backend skills.

## 3. Learn a Frontend Framework

Modern web apps rely on frameworks like:
- **React.js** (Most popular, widely used in industry)
- **Vue.js** (Beginner-friendly, great for small projects)
- **Svelte** (Efficient and lightweight alternative)

## 4. Master Version Control (Git & GitHub)

Git is essential for collaborating and tracking code changes. Learn how to:
```sh
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
```
Use GitHub to showcase your projects.

## 5. Explore Backend Technologies

Learn about backend development with:
- **Node.js (Express.js)** – JavaScript runtime for server-side apps.
- **Python (Django/Flask)** – Great for data-driven applications.
- **Databases:** Learn SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB, Firebase).

## 6. Build Real-World Projects

Create projects to apply your skills. Start with:
- A personal portfolio website
- A to-do list app
- A weather app using APIs
- A blog with authentication (Full-stack project)

## 7. Learn About Deployment & Hosting

Host your projects using:
- **Vercel** (Great for Next.js and React apps)
- **Netlify** (Static site hosting)
- **Render/Heroku** (Backend hosting)

## 8. Stay Updated & Keep Practicing

Web development evolves quickly. Follow blogs, join communities, and keep coding:
